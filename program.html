    <!-- Other important information about the major -->
     <h5> Other Important Notes </h5>
     <p>
      Students must earn a grade of “C” or better for any course to be applied to the Information Systems major. <br>
      A student must first complete MATH 155, IS 147, IS 300, and IS 310 to fulfill the gateway requirements. <br>
      Examples of upper-level electives that could be used to help fulfill the IS major requirements include: IS 303, IS 304, IS 460, IS 461, IS 427, IS 428, IS 430, IS 438, IS 464, IS 471, IS 472, IS 451U, IS 451M, and IS 452, as well as others (see catalog for a full listing). <br>
      There are also several special courses, including IS 399, IS 478, IS 479, IS 469, IS 397, and IS 467, among others, that cannot be used to satisfy the IS upper-level elective requirement, but that students can use to gain academic credit for internships, coops, and research projects. See your advisor for more information.
